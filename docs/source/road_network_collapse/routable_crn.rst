Overview
========

The CRN has been segmented at each and every arc intersection to support meshblock creation. However, this effectively
makes the network unroutable with respect to real-world connectivity between roads. Therefore, the CRN must contain a
dissolve indicator / overpass attribute on which a subset of roads which have been segmented, but are contiguous in
reality, can be merged into single features. An interim point dataset representing all crossings of a specified order
should also be maintained to simplify the update process after deltas integration phases.

.. admonition:: Crossings Order

    Order represents the number of features connected to a crossing point. In this context, 4 is the minimum order used
    to identify points to be exported to the crossings dataset because this is seen as the minimum order involving
    real-world, multi-level road crossings (overpasses). Technically, it is possible to used 3 (dead end terminating
    directly beneath another road), but this would exponentially increase the number of points requiring review for
    only a handful of valid instances.

**Layers:**

:``crossings_deltas``: Crossings differences relative to the existing crossings dataset.

    - ``Additions``: New crossings.
    - ``Deletions``: Removed crossings.
    - ``Modifications``: Preserved crossings with a different order (feature count).
:``crossings``: Crossings dataset, symbolized according to overpass status.
:``crn_roads``: CRN roads, used to determine if each crossing point contains dissolvable features.
:``Esri Satellite``: Reference WMS for recent imagery context.
