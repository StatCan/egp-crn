Overview
========

The work on the NRN and the NGD layers is continuous.
Updates, changes, and/or modifications (deltas) yield multiple periodic vintages of each dataset,
meaning that the CRN is continuously being outdated.
Therefore, these deltas must be identified, inspected, and properly integrated into the CRN for it to fully realize its
purpose as a foundational layer for the Enterprise Geospatial Platform (EGP) by providing an accurate and unified
representation of both the NRN project and NGDâ€™s NGD_AL layer and all their dependent operations and layers (e.g. NGD_A).

.. admonition:: Note

    This section is temporary, it will be updated with each delta phase and will eventually be removed once this task
    is completed.

.. admonition:: Note

    The inclusion of provinces and territories in a delta phase depends on their completion status with regards to the
    other CRN processes such as topology validation, meshblock creation, and meshblock conflation. Therefore,
    some provinces/territories may be excluded from a certain delta phase. For such provinces/territories,
    the integration of Deltas will be implemented in the next phases.
