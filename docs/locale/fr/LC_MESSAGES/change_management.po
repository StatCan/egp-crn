"The objective is to update the NVD data on a regular basis as soon as "
"mechanisms have been established between NVD’s partners. One of the "

" of change."

"words, the NVD does not monitor real changes in the territory; they "

"or descriptive modification or confirmation of the preceding state can "
"occur, while maintaining the same NID. Data with the effects "
